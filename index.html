    <p class="message">
      Hey Em,  
      I just wanted to create a website to say I‚Äôm really sorry. I chose a website because I told you I would begin to learn how to code. I know recently I haven't been as attentive with our relationship and towards making the changes you wanted to see from me. Thats all on me. I know I haven't been committed enough to changing this month and I'm sorry that I ever put you through this pain.
    </p>
    <p class="message">
      I will be quitting games following the completion of this website. I dont need anything in my life that doesn't bring me anything positive. It has been destroying my life and it ends now. The last thing I ever want is for you to feel unappreciated. I don't want your feelings to fade because I haven't been showing up in our relationship and for myself recently.
    </p>
    <p class="message"></p>
      I know that my words aren't enough to repair this situation. I just want you to know that I acknowledge my mistakes and am committing to change. I want to do better for myself but also for us. I don't love anyone more than I love you.
    </p>
    <p class="message">
      I want there to be a future together with you. I know there is the possibility but I do need to truly change all my bad ways.
    </p>
    <p class="closing">I love you, forever and always. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

      <p>Em, please let me make it up to you by coming over and cooking you a meal. I would really appreciate the chance to sit down, talk about us, and work through our issues with a nice home-cooked dinner. You mean the world to me so please give me the chance to make this right. I've said enough now i'll talk about the rest over dinner. I love you so much.</p>
